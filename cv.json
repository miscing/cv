One production VM (CentOS) is exposed to internet, others are for development (Fedora) and a single gitlab runner (CoreOS). Firewall is configured with nftables and Firewalld, access to development VM's via wireguard or lan and ssh. All development VM's are run on separate nat networks, production VM is run on a routed network. You can see some details in the helper scripts located in the kvm-scripts repository.
