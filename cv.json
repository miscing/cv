Managed to half the pipeline run time and increase overall throughput using considerably weaker hardware. Ultimately the set up became autoscaling which required tailoring the drone upstream product, so throughput is even higher now. The testing environment allowed 'promoting' any branch to the env providing a full version of the app based off that branch. Used kvm for virtualiazing each instance and containers to set up the app in the instance.","options":{"file":[".gitlab-ci.yml","main.yml"]}},{"name":"testing","text":"Testing reduces work when implementing new features and maintaining code.

After my university years I found my love for computers and eventually coding. Since then I have spent the majority of my time coding or tweaking Linux systems, I particularly enjoy learning new computer skills and consider myself adept at quickly picking up new programming languages, libraries and frameworks. While my strengths lie in backend, I have also built websites and dabbled in data analysis. At my last job I worked my way from junior backend coder to DevOps, my most ambitious finalized project was the full containerization of our app, rebuilding of the CICD from scratch and ultimately build automated staging/testing environments. I have also refactored parts of the backend code and helped out with some smaller frontend react jobs. In my free time I mostly work on my own projects using angular, golang and linux/containers (Run on my own homelab :) )\n\n\tIf you are looking for a motivated and social coder who isn't afraid of learning new skills, here I am."],"langs":[{"name":"english","level":3},{"name":"spanish","level":2},{"name":"finnish","level":3}],"custom":[{"key":"drivers license","value":"AB, EU"},{"key":"company","value":"Oniservus"}]},"timeline":[{"present":true,"start":{"month":3,"year":2021},"end":{"month":5,"year":2022},"desc":"Developer at LocalBitcoins Oy"},{"start":{"month":11,"year":2019},"end":{"month":3,"year":2021},"desc":"Oniservus: website, hosting and IT consultant company.
