One production VM (CentOS) is exposed to internet, others are for development (Fedora) and a single gitlab runner (CoreOS). Firewall is configurated with nftables and Firewalld, access to development VM's via wireguard or lan and ssh. All development VM's are run on seperate nat networks, production VM is run on a routed network. You can see some details in the helper scripts in the kvm-scripts repository."},{"name":"frontend","options":{"urls":["https://white-lynx.fi"]}},{"name":"typescript/javascript","options":{"topics":["javascript","typescript"]}},{"name":"golang"},{"name":"cicd","options":{"file":[".gitlab-ci.yml"]}}],"profile":{"links":[{"name":"github","url":"https://github.com/miscing","username":"miscing"},{"name":"gitlab","url":"https://gitlab.com/miscing","username":"miscing"},{"name":"matrix","url":"https://app.element.io/","text":"@miscing:matrix.org"}],"firstname":"Alexander","surname":"Saastamoinen","pic":"assets/profile.jpg"}}
