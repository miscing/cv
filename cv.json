One production VM (CentOS) is exposed to internet, others are for development (Fedora) and a single gitlab runner (CoreOS). Firewall is configurated with nftables and Firewalld, access to development VM's via wireguard or lan and ssh. All development VM's are run on seperate nat networks, production VM is run on a routed network. You can see some details in the helper scripts in the kvm-scripts repository. All software in production is run on podman/docker.\nI typically run my own http servers written in golang, although the code is private since they are exposed to the internet."},{"name":"frontend","level":2,"text":"Primarily developed using Angular framework, but am happy to learn any framework or use pure javascript.","options":{"urls":["https://white-lynx.fi","https://alakoski.fi"]}},{"name":"virtualization","level":2},{"name":"cicd","text":"Primarily use gitlab cicd with a self-hosted runner, but have also used github cicd for its pages.","options":{"file":[".gitlab-ci.yml","main.yml"]}},{"name":"data-science","level":1},{"name":"docker/podman","level":4,"text":"I use both docker and podman extensively, and have created a (currently private) database-like program using docker api.
