    - text: "I run the following homelab setup: \nHardware:\tHP ProLiant ML350p, 2 Xeon E5, 64Gb ram\nOperating system:\tCentOS 8\n\nCentOS is a headless server acting purely as kvm hypervisor, ontop of it I run multiple VM's, usually cloned from a base thin lvm image. One production VM (CentOS) is exposed to internet, others are for development (Fedora) and a single gitlab runner (CoreOS). Firewall is configurated with nftables and Firewalld, access to development VM's via wireguard or lan and ssh. All development VM's are run on seperate nat networks, production VM is run on a routed network. You can see some details in the helper scripts in the kvm-scripts repository."
