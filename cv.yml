about:
  - "A passionate coder and computer enthusiast, I started my adult career studying for a Bachelor Programme in International Business at Aalto university. After my university years I found my love for computers and eventually, coding. Since then I have spent the majority of my time coding or tweaking Linux systems, I particularly enjoy learning new computer skills, and consider myself adept at quickly picking up programming languages, libraries and frameworks. While my strengths lie in low level (Linux) stuff, I have also built websites and dabbled in data analysis such as discrete Fourier transform and machine learning. My years of business studies and running my single-person company (I imported and sold industrial parts in Finland) have also given me a solid understanding of finance, sales and customer service. It has also made me a very social person who enjoys working with others in projects as well as performing presentations and other public events. Before all this I spent my formative years in Spain, before moving to Finland at the age of 8. This has given me a multicultural outlook on life as well as a native speaker dominance of Finnish, Spanish and English. Of these, by far my strongest language is English, having been in English-speaking environments since kindergarten. In my free time I like to read, climb, ski, scuba-dive (not so often in Finland) or go camping. Nevertheless, my true leisure time love has to be good food.\n\n\tIf you are looking for a motivated and social coder who isn't afraid of learning new skills, here I am."

skills:
  - backend:
    - level: 3
    - text: "I run the following homelab setup: \nHardware:\tHP ProLiant ML350p, 2 Xeon E5, 64Gb ram\nOperating system:\tCentOS 8\n\nCentOS is a headless server acting purely as kvm hypervisor, ontop of it I run multiple VM's, usually cloned from a base thin lvm image. One production VM (CentOS) is exposed to internet, others are for development (Fedora) and a single gitlab runner (CoreOS). Firewall is configured with nftables and Firewalld, access to development VM's via wireguard or lan and ssh. All development VM's are run on separate nat networks, production VM is run on a routed network. You can see some details in the helper scripts located in the kvm-scripts repository. All software in production is run on podman.\nI typically run my own http servers written in go, although most of that code is private since they are exposed to the internet."

    - text: "I have used mariadb in the past as a database, lately usage is limited to linking mariadb official container to other solutions such as matomo, wordpress and mattermost using podman pods. While I am not currently proficient with mysql, I feel confident in my ability to work with it if necessary as well as fully capable of designing and implementing a SQL database."
  - linux:
    - level: 4
    - text: "I have run Linux computers for over 10 years. Started from Mint/Ubuntu then installed Arch from scratch. Since then I have obsessively improved my knowledge and skills with Linux systems, currently running CentOS on my home lab and Fedora for development servers and laptop. I have fairly extensive knowledge of internals, ranging from ssh/gpg to systemd and kernel modules. Although, as I primarily use my computer from the terminal, my knowledge of GUI parts of Linux is limited."
  - virtualization:
    - text: "I use kvm/libvirt via virsh to operate my homelab containing a production vm, multiple development vm's and a cicd runner."
    - level: 3
  - docker/podman:
    - level: 4
    - text: "I use both docker and podman extensively. I have also created a (currently private) database-like program using docker api. Many of my projects include container images available in the corresponding gitlab repositories container registry. My self-hosted production code resides in a container on top of podman. I also have some, very limited, experience with kubernetes."

      - ".gitlab-ci.yml"
      - "main.yml"
  - git:
    - level: 3
    - text: "I use git primarily from commandline. Gitlab for development(for its issue's and cicd) and mirror to github my public/open repos. I have some experience with the features of all three, including self-hosting pure-git and gitlab(very limited). I also use both gitlab-python api and github octokit for automating many of my git operations."
    - octokit
  - networking:
    - level: 2
    - text: "I know the basics of networking and firewalls. This consists of an understanding (and a fair amount of practical experience) of routing (ip rule, route, netns), iptables/nftables and a very basic understanding of networking layers. I am also familiar with troubleshooting with nmap, traceroute and wireshark/tshark. Additionally I have setup wireguard as a vpn solution."
  - data-science:
    - level: 1
    - text: "Done online courses on signal processing(EPFL DSP course) and machine learning (Andrew Ng), although I only know the very bare basics and have limited experience. However, I am eager to learn more should the opportunity arise."
