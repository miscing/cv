about:
  - " A passionate coder and computer enthusiast, I started with a Bachelor Programme in International Business at Aalto university. After my university years I found my love for computers and eventually coding. Since then I have spent the majority of my time coding or tweaking Linux systems, I particularly enjoy learning new computer skills and consider myself adept at quickly picking up new programming languages, libraries and frameworks. While my strengths lie in backend, I have also built websites and dabbled in data analysis. At my last job I worked my way from junior backend coder to DevOps, my most ambitious finalized project was the full containerization of our app, rebuilding of the CICD from scratch and ultimately build automated staging/testing environments. I have also refactored parts of the backend code and helped out with some smaller frontend react jobs. In my free time I mostly work on my own projects using angular, golang and linux/containers (Run on my own homelab :) )\n\n\tIf you are looking for a motivated and social coder who isn't afraid of learning new skills, here I am."

skills:
  - backend:
    - level: 4
    - text: "Probably better at backend than frontend. Worked mostly with golang and python/django. Build CICD bots, http servers, reverse proxy's, rest api's. All the usual stuff. Not as experienced with database parts."
  - frontend:
    - level: 3
    - text: "I have sold, made and delivered multiple websites for customers, custom build from scratch using Angular. Most of my experience is with Angular framework, but I am always excited to learn new frameworks and libraries. I am particularly proud of the code that generates this CV (mostly cause I made it in a couple of days), check it out! Since then I've made more extensive and complicated projects with angular with extensive e2e tests, unfortunately they're not publicly available (yet)."

  - golang:
    - text: "My goto language for building anything, unless there's a good reason to use something else."
    - level: 4
  - bash:
    - text: "I've used it alot, but its complexity, readibility and maintainability have made me regret it often. Lot of bash in CICD pipelines though, with all the escaping that involves."

  - c:

  - sql:
    - level: 2
    - text: "I can read, write and use mysql (and tried most of the popular variants) decently, although I would need to learn much more before getting involved with complex production databases."
  - linux:
    - level: 4
    - text: "Extensive experience with debian and rpm based distro's, both in cloud and own hardware."
  - virtualization:
    - text: "Used kvm with ignition+coreos to set up automated testing environments. I also use kvm/libvirt via virsh to operate my homelab, which contains dev environments, cicd runners and production vm's."
    - level: 3
  - containers:
    - level: 4
    - text: "I've containerized monolith/legacy applications. Nowadays I use containers for... well... everything. Played around quite a lot with the internals also."

      - "Dockerfile"
    - docker
    - podman
  - cicd:
    - text: "Built a CICD setup from scratch with on demand automated staging/testing environments using drone cicd, containers and golang. Managed to half the pipeline run time and increase overall throughput using considerably weaker hardware. Ultimately the set up became autoscaling which required tailoring the drone upstream product, so throughput is even higher now. The testing environment allowed 'promoting' any branch to the env providing a full version of the app based off that branch. Used kvm for virtualiazing each instance and containers to set up the app in the instance."

  - git:
    - level: 3
    - text: "Pretty nifty with git, although it's so large and awesome there's always more to learn."
    - octokit
  - networking:
    - level: 3
    - text: "Built networks with nftables and ip suite. Got fairly good knowledge with the common tools (nmap, tshark, firewalld, etc)."
  - data-science:
    - level: 1
    - text: "Done online courses on signal processing(EPFL DSP course) and machine learning (Andrew Ng), although I only know the very bare basics and have limited experience. However, I am eager to learn more should the opportunity arise."
